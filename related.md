## The Hand of Kas

The Hand of Kas was the original artifact Vecna altered to make the Hand of Vecna.
Created by Kas, who himself had made it from the Staff of Arkon, the staff syphoned
life energy from around the user into themself.

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage
rolls made with it. It also has 30 charges, and regains 1d4+3 charges each dawn. You may
expend a number of charges to use the following effects:
- Ray of Sickness (2 charges):
  the Hand of Kas produces a sickly green beam, 5 ft. wide and 60 ft. long.
  Any creature in this area takes 4d8 necrotic damage and must make a
  Constitution saving throw (DC 17) or be poisoned for 1 minute. The user
  restores a number of hitpoints equal to 1d6 for every creature hit.
- Enfeeblement Strike (1 charge):
  make a melee weapon attack with the Hand of Kas. If it hits, the target
  must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's
  Strength is reduced by half, and any weapon damage dealt by them is reduced
  by half as well. They may attempt the saving throw again once at the end of
  each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. While the effect persists,
  your Strength is increased by 2, to a maximum of 20.
- Blight (2 charges):
  you cast the spell Blight. If the target fails their saving throw, you regain
  a number of hitpoints equal to the damage dealt.
- Circle of Death (3 charges):
  You cast the spell Circle of Death. For every creature that fails their saving throw,
  you gain 2d10 temporary hitpoints.
- Horrid Wilting (4 charges):
  You cast the spell Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting. Your hitpoints maximum and current hitpoints are
  increased by 1d6 for every target in the area. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest.
