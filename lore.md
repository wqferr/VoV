# Vestiges of Vecna
## Introduction
The Vestiges were artifacts first used by Vecna in her quest for Lichdom.
They were either crafted entirely by her (the Eye and the Heart) or were
modified to suit her needs (the Hand).
The core component of each of them are Soul Stones.

## Soul Stones
The Soul Stone is an invention of Vecna herself. Transmuter
Stones turned prisons of souls, they could store and maintain
spells as long as there were souls it could consume. When a
Soul Stone has souls in it, a faint silver glow in its core is
visible. The glow increases intensity with the number and power of souls
stored, and has a faint pulse to its brightness like a heartbeat.

## Amplification
Individually, the Vestiges are incredibly powerful artifacts,
coveted by many spellcasters. As a group, however, the Soul
Stones resonate and amplify each other even further.

## Temptation
Though long vanquished, Vecna's influence still takes place
through her Vestiges. Each was imbued with a part of her
soul upon creation, and therefore carries her will. They will
purposefully be found, assume a different form to better suit
potential users, and tempt them into reuniting the artifacts.

While the fool accomplishes the task, the artifacts slowly
corrupt them. They may demand the user do an evil act, or
they may drain power from the carrier to sustain themselves.
With the promise of unimaginable power (and a bit of magic
induced delusion), the host obliges.

## Vecna Lives
Upon reuniting all three Vestiges, the user either goes insane
or is overpowered by the relics. Either way, their soul is
slowly absorbed into The Heart. It is ground, processed and
ultimately destroyed over time. The power extracted from it is
then used to reignite Vecna's soul, which takes over the host's
body after its soul is completely consumed. The original soul
cannot be recovered.

If Vecna is defeated again, her soul is transferred back into
the Vestiges. They then disappear, evaporating into a thin,
glowing white dust. A na√Øve observer may confuse this for the
destruction of the artifacts. Experience tells, though, that they
are merely being transported somewhere else. Somewhere
safe, where they will wait until the world has forgotten of this
incident. And try again.
